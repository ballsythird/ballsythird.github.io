### Background

Not exactly sure, if I'm going to sit for placements this year, but what's the harm in exploring a few nice Brainstellar Questions. Will try to expound on each one of them and dump the findings here.


### Rolling the bullet


> Two bullets are loaded into a gun's round barrel consecutively. The barrel has a capacity of 6. The gun is fired once, but no bullet is shot. Does rolling the barrel (shuffling) before next shot increase the probability of firing a bullet?
>
>> Answer : Simple and Standard. The first slot could only be in one of 4 poistions, only one of which could lead to the next slot actually containing the bullet, and there, we've found the answer, that if we do not shuffle the barrel, we have only $\frac{1}{4}$ probability of hitting ourselves, against the shuffled's $\frac{2}{6}$.

There could be further variations of the problem : 

> Suppose the bullet is in two randomly chosen slots.
>> This is obvious!

> Suppose the bullets are in two slots, such that they have either 1/3 slots between them.
>> Check it for yourself. The probability of shooting on second shot, when not-shuffling would come out to be $\frac{2}{4}$ against shuffling's $\frac{2}{3}$
